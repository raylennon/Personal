HackMIT 2022 was a blast. I flew out to Boston, took a taxi to MIT's campus, and almost immediately got to work brainstorming project ideas with my three-person team (myself, and two CMU computer science students). After hours of contemplation, we landed on an idea to create an open-ended video game called Roots based on Shel Silverstein's 'The Giving Tree'. The game's premise is simple: as a tree, decide whether to grow your roots or your branches, as the forest environment around you symbiotically responds and adapts. To survive storms, your tree must have a strong root structure and support the animals of the forest. 

I designed all of the 3d assets in <a href="https://blender.org/">Blender</a>, while my teammates designed the game functionality in <a href="https://unity.com/">Unity</a>. For our game's unique concept, visual style, and themes of connectness and selflessness, our team was the sole winner of the Meta Metaverse Challenge, and each of us was awarded a pair of <a href="https://www.ray-ban.com/usa/electronics/RW4002ray-ban%20stories%20%7C%20wayfarer-black/8056597705110">RayBans Stories</a>.
