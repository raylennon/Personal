I started an education technology company called Realms with two Duke MBA students. The goal of Realms is to make Zoom classrooms more engaging: the app collects live comprehension feedback from students and uses it to identify challenge areas and offer at-a-glance course feedback for professors. I led development on front and back-end systems for the app, including an interactive HTML interface and cloud-hosted database. Throughout the development process I learned how to set up a massively scalable <a href="https://nodejs.org/en">NodeJS</a> server on AWS, how to integrate database structures with <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>, and how to integrate the entire platform as an <a href="https://developers.zoom.us/docs/integrations/">OAuth Zoom app</a>.

During development of a functioning prototype, Realms was pitched to several universities, drawing widespread interest and feedback. The team is currently in the process of distributing Realms as an open-source platform to Duke University, the University of North Carolina, and NC State University for improving engagement in classrooms.
