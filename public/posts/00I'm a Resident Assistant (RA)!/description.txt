In my senior year, I'm an RA in Duke's Craven Quad! The year started off with two weeks of training where I learned about how to build community, be a residential leader, and keep everyone safe in the process. My favorite part was welcoming the thousands of new freshmen - class of 2027 - to Duke inside of the legendary Cameron Indoor Stadium. 

Halfway through the first semester, things are going great; I've hosted community events and faculty dinners, and I've loved getting to know everyone in my section.
