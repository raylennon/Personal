I'm honored to have been awarded the annual Noble Prize for my contributions at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory!

In particular, the award recognizes my team's work on the project MAINER (Manipulating Atmospheric Ice Nucleation Events, Redux), which targets the development of novel bio-derived cloud seeding applications. My role on the project involved performing data aggregation and analysis from satellite imagery, to uncover global patterns in high-atmospheric cloud formation.
