Over the past semester, during my office hours as a TA, I created a robot using a Raspberry Pi, a mobile phone charger, and some scrounged parts. 

The robot, which, for lack of a better name, is currently "Ray's Dog", runs a python Flask server over campus wifi. It's equipped with a livestreaming camera, an LCD display for custom messages/ faces, and two bidirectional two motors.

I showed off my robot dog at Duke's <a href="https://colab.duke.edu/">Innovation Co-Lab</a> Makerfair 2023 - he made a ton of new friends, and got some great recommendations for new features!
