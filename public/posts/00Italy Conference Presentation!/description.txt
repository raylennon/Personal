In September I presented original work for the first time at an international conference -the 12th Annual <a href="https://constructal.org/">Constructal Law Conference</a>, in Turin, Italy!

The conference draws scholars from around the world to discuss representational similarities and connections between many types of physical systems - from economics to geology - and explores modelling them through the tenets of fundamental principles of heat & mass transfer.

My presentation, A Constructal Perspective on the Time Evolution of Social Networks, reflected on the propagation of online & physical social networks as hierarchical flow systems, and presented a framework for modelling the propagation of online information.
