I was super excited to host a Blender 3D modelling workshop this past weekend! I taught a group of fellow Duke students the capabilities of Blender, my favorite piece of open-source 3D software, as it pertains to creating low-poly models for game development and animation. We went over the fundamentals of geometry-based modelling, topology, sculpting, and material assignment.
